<h1>League of Legends</h1>
<h2>Explained?</h2>
<p>This will just be a breif explanation of the game before my opinions on whether or not the game should or shouldn't be played.</p>
<br>
<p>The game League of Legends is classified as a MOBA a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, for league this means that there will be atleast 10 people in the game each playing a champion, depending on the game mode it could even be the same champion as you.</p>
<br>
<p>You and your teamates objective is to win the game (surprising I know) but to do this you don't have to defeat the enemy players themselves (alothough you can fight and defeat them) the way to win is to take the enemys objectives e.g the towers, inhibitors and and finally the Nexus. </p>
<br>
<p>Along the way can take multiple other onjectives like 4 elemental dragons which order will appear at random and grant multiple different buffs, you can also take 2 different buff red and blue which grant 2 different effect as well. as the maps are mirrored there is atleast 4 of these camps for both teams you can take your's and there's IF you're feeling risky.</p>
