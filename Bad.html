    <h1>5 reasons not to play League of Legends</h1> 
    <br>
    <h2>The community is atrocious, racist and kind of the worst</h2>
    <p>The community can be a terrible experience, sometimes it's okay but alot of the community has grown so used to being toxic during a game that they don't think it's even that bad anymore when it 100% is that bad. Now this may not be all the time as there are still some sane people left.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>You will always feel pressured to buy skin's</h3>
    <p>No matter where you look you will always see upcomming skin's for champions you like or want to play or think look cool... DON'T DO IT!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>There's to many champion!</h3>
    <p>The amount of champions in the game can be staggering and to play win games you will need to know atleast a little about each to survive against them, which is a massive learning curve when you're just trying to figure out the game.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Pay to win?! kind of...</h4>
    <p>You don't have to pay to win, but good look getting the champion you want when they all have different values and you have to disenchant champions shards for blue essence to get the champion you want or hope you get the champion shard you want and then use blue essence on that as well... or spend money and get it ya know your choice ;)</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Broken Champs</h5>
    <p>Now there are alot of good champs in LoL (league of legends) but the best champs arn't just broken, there's almost zero chance of winning against them which can be the most frustrating thing to play against, as there is so many champions balance is somthing that can be incredible difficult, with so many champs in the game it is incredible difficult to keep track and constantly update, to make the game more fair for all players playing there champs.</p>
